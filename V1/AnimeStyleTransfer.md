A reliable anime style transfer has been chasing by the whole ACG related ML community for more than 2 years.

We are excited now because maybe we solved the problem 30 minutes ago, just by adding some toggles to style2paints, and the results are amazing.

You can try it directly at **style2paints.github.io**.

You can use images in *github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints/tree/master/images_in_style_transfer*. 

Or you can try with your own images, but keep in mind that your content images should be HD, those more than 720p resolution are recommended.

Just click *upSketch* for content image and *upReference* for style image, **do not forget to click V4 (or V3 in some cases) and the SX toggle**.

I mean **do not forget to click V4 (or V3 in some cases) and the SX toggle**.

Maybe the method is unstable in some cases, but look here:
